After more than a one-year hiatus, the Chicken Crawl returned in style with its stop at the highly anticipated Honey Butter. **#TheCrawl #TheRevival**

While I can't support this claim, I was told by another patron that the casual vibe and layout drew inspiration from its former life as a Mexican Restaurant/bar, evident by the casual and inviting atmosphere as well as its great outdoor space. Although the outdoor seating was definitely welcoming (maybe too welcoming?), our crew suffered from user error by actually sitting on the outdoor patio despite the tepid weather.

I appreciated how Honey Butter had a mix of high-end beers and cocktails, as well as the more expected beverage accompaniments for fried chicken (lemonade, High Life, Hamm's, etc.).

Despite the crew's miscalculated seating selection, we more than made up for it with our family style selection of eats, which included:
* Two 8-piece assortment of fried chicken 
* mac n' cheese
* grits
* mashed potatoes
* biscuits - ALL OF THE SAUCES (good add on by CJ)

The chicken was good, however, I felt a little deceived upon biting into the bird as none of my three pieces were bone-in (though I understand a couple of the drumsticks had bones). There is no debate that bone-in chicken contains more flavor and juices than its boneless contemporary. For me, this is unacceptable. It tasted rather flat as though I was merely biting into a pre-processed assembly of chicken (vs. an all-natural bird that was ripe with juicy flavor).

The saving grace for the chicken was the restaurant's namesake - the Honey Butter. Never would I have imagined flavoring chicken with either item as a standalone (honey or butter), but with their power combined it created a sweet yet smooth accompaniment that made the chicken extremely delicious.

None of the side items left a lasting impact, however, the platter of food was the perfect amount of food where we weren't left feeling too full or under served, so good job by us.
