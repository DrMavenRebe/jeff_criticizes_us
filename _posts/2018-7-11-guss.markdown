The only thing questionable* about Gus's is its use of an apostrophe "s", this chicken was on point!

Located in Fulton Market's (formerly) industrial area, I half-expected a little more rugged and less-finished look/feel, so I was pleasantly surprised upon entry. While not quaint by any means, Gus's was able to hone-in on the southern comfort and authenticity with picnic tables, checkered table clothes an open kitchen concept. We've also been to a couple of places which are disproportionately small despite their oversized reputation, so considering my little man JVP was in attendance I was especially pleased with Gus's size and general comfort.

Not only, but the availability to order 40's and drink straight from the bag was a nice finishing touch which rounded out the experience. However, while their beer menu appeared robust, they're gonna get docked some points for their shortage of supplies - my girl had to place an order three times until they finally had her drink in stock!

As usual, we ordered family style, and as usual, I thought we ordered too much but our crew did not disappoint! I literally think there were only 2-3 things we did not order. Here we go:

- Fried Pickles: Juicy, tart and crunchy and served as a nice pallet warm-up for all of the fried goodness still to come. Not only, but I've never seen a fried pickle served vertically, so I really appreciated the execution. 
- French Fries: For me, these weren't very memorable. If there's one thing I'd skip on my next visit, these wold be excluded.
- Baked Beans: I'm always a sucker for baked beans, so these are always an obligatory side item. With that said, equally not very memorable.
- Greens: Did we ever actually figure out what collared greens are?! In any case, we needed some color and a veggie on our plate so these were definitely a must have. Had a plain spinich-y taste to them, but not quite as flavorful.
- Cole Slaw: Just like its friend the baked beans, cole slaw is often perceived as an obligatory side, but I actually think that this was the most underrated item on the menu. Too often, slaw is just shredded cabbage sopped in mayo, but I really enjoyed the balance of vinaigrette dressing and mayo - it was the perfect combo and created a nice, sweet and creamy finish.
- Mac n' Cheese: Yummy - well done.
- Chicken Fingers: I was reluctant to order but Lindz' insistence was overpowering. We're all familiar with my preference for bone-in vs. bone-out, but these I found relatively moist and full of flavor. I'd probably skip next time but glad I gave these adult chicken nuggets a try.
- THE CHICKEN: Was a little nervous about the size of our 16-piece order (it seemed pretty big for five people, including two chicks - hah, chicks) but it turned out to be the perfect amount. What I especially appreciated was the mixed plate of thighs, legs and wings. In terms of flavor, these were cooked to perfection. Perfectly moist and the crispyness-level was perfect. Not too hard or overly fried, but just right where the crunch was audibly delicious. 
- Pecan Pie and Chocolate Chess Pie: Yes and yes. You know that feeling when you're too full to continue, but you do it anyway? I legitimately think I ate half of each of these. 

**Looking forward to the next one - CACAW!**

*Also questionable, Bobby claims I visited the OG in Memphis, which I do not recall
