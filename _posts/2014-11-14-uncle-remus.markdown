I don't know about you, but I only found the chicken to be adequate. Maybe I set my expectations a little too high, considering I've been scheming to visit this place since the summer. I felt like the chicken was very plain and unseasoned. I felt like every bite was literally just biting into fried flour and cornstarch. I didn't try the spicy sauce, but the mild sauce was very, um, asian tasting. It was this really goopy, fruity, glue like substance that would've been better served with egg roles.

If my rating was strictly based on the food, it'd probably have a lower rating. But, you cannot make this rating without factoring in the experience. When the only decor in your restaurant include signs that read, "Do Not Talk On The Phone While Ordering" and wallpaper that read, "No parking in the parking lot. Cars will be towed," you know you're in the right spot. It's almost unnecessary to point out, but the fact that we decided to eat around/on my car was amazing and was probably the highlight of my car's life (though, this car has survived longer than any of my previous, so that's a positive).
